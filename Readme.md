**Table 1. 1961 Underwood 18 Manual Typewriter Controls and Indicators.**

| **KEY** | **CONTROL/INDICATOR** | **FUNCTION** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Carriage Return Lever | When user begins typing, the carriage is over to the right (at the beginning of the page) and will continuously move to the left as the user reaches the end of the page (signaled by the bell). When Carriage Return Lever is pushed all the way over, it advances the page up and back to the right (to the second line) so user can continue typing. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2. | Line Space Selector | Changes the line spacing. User can use the following:
1. Single-space
2. Double-space

1. Platen is free (don't use this)
 |
| 3. | Margin Stops | Creates the left and right margins of the paper (can be moved to create shorter or longer margins). |
| 4. | Ribbon Color Selector | Selects color for typing (either red or black). |
| 5. | Ribbon Reversal | Changes the direction of the ribbon spools. |
| 6 | Paper Rest | Holds paper in vertical position for easier typing. |
| 7. | Paper Release | Enables user to remove paper without rolling platen knobs. |
| 8. | Platen Knob | User can turn forwards or backwards to move paper up or down. |
| 9. | Keys | A QWERTY keyboard layout used for manual input of character data.
 Special keys:
- **Backspace key:** Located beside the "!" key, this key goes back one space. This doesn't remove the typed character. If user makes an error, either use correction fluid to mark the error and type over it _ **OR** _ backspace over the errors and type over them with the "X" key.
- **Margin release key:** Located underneath the backspace key, this key allows user to type beyond the set margins.
- **Shift keys:** Located on either side of keyboard, beside "Z" and "." keys respectively, these keys allow user to capitalize letters and use the alternate functions of the numeric keyboard.
- **Shift Lock key:** Located next to "A" key, this key allows the user to write in all caps. To disable the Shift Lock function, press the Shift key.
